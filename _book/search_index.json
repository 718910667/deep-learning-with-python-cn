TensorFlow入门\nTensorFlow是Google创造的数值运算库，作为深度学习的底层使用。本章包括：\n\nTensorFlow介绍\n如何用TensorFlow定义、编译并运算表达式\n如何寻求帮助\n\n注意：TensorFlow暂时不支持Windows，你可以用Docker或虚拟机。Windows用户可以不看这章。\n3.1 TensorFlow是什么？\nTensorFlow是开源数学计算引擎，由Google创造，用Apache 2.0协议发布。TF的API是Python的，但底层是C++。和Theano不同，TF兼顾了工业和研究，在RankBrain、DeepDream等项目中使用。TF可以在单个CPU或GPU，移动设备以及大规模分布式系统中使用。\n3.2 安装TensorFlow\nTF支持Python 2.7和3.3以上。安装很简单：\nsudo pip install TensorFlow\n就好了。\n3.3 TensorFlow例子\nTF的计算是用图表示的：\n\n节点：节点进行计算，有一个或者多个输入输出。节点间的数据叫张量：多维实数数组。\n边缘：定义数据、分支、循环和覆盖的图，也可以进行高级操作，例如等待某个计算完成。\n操作：取一个输入值，得出一个输出值，例如，加减乘除。\n\n3.4 简单的TensorFlow\n简单说一下TensorFlow：我们定义a和b两个浮点变量，定义一个表达式（c=a+b），将表达式变成函数，编译，进行计算：\nimport tensorflow as tf\n# declare two symbolic floating-point scalars\na = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)\nb = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)\n# create a simple symbolic expression using the add function add = tf.add(a, b)\n# bind 1.5 to 'a', 2.5 to 'b', and evaluate 'c'\nsess = tf.Session()\nbinding = {a: 1.5, b:

Keras是什么？\nKeras可以基于Theano或TensorFlow建立深度学习模型，方便研究和开发。Keras可以在Python 2.7或3.5运行，无痛调用后端的CPU或GPU网络。Keras由Google的Francois Chollet开发，遵循以下原则：\n\n模块化：每个模块都是单独的流程或图，深度学习的所有问题都可以通过组装模块解决\n简单化：提供解决问题的最简单办法，不加装饰，最大化可读性\n扩展性：新模块的添加特别容易，方便试验新想法\nPython：不使用任何自创格式，只使用原生Python\n\n4.2 安装Keras\nKeras很好安装，但是你需要至少安装Theano或TensorFlow之一。\n使用PyPI安装Keras：\nsudo pip install keras\n本书完成时，Keras的最新版本是1.0.1。下面这句话可以看Keras的版本：\npython -c \"import keras; print

多层感知器入门","keywords":"","body":"第6章 多层感知器入门\n神经网络很神奇，但是一开始学起来很痛苦，涉及大量术语和算法。本章主要介绍多层感知器的术语和使用方法。本章将：\n\n介绍神经网络的神经元、权重和激活函数\n如何使用构建块建立网络\n如何训练网络\n\n我们开始吧。\n6.1 绪论\n本节课的内容很多：\n\n多层感知器\n神经元、权重和激活函数\n神经元网络\n网络训练\n\n我们从多层感知器开始谈起。\n6.2 多层感知器\n（译者注：本书中的“神经网络”一般指“人工神经网络”）\n在一般的语境中，人工神经网络一般指神经网络，或者，多层感知器。感知器是简单的神经元模型，大型神经网络的前体。这个领域主要研究大脑如何通过简单的生物学结构解决复杂的计算问题，例如，进行预测。最终的目标不是要建立大脑的真正模型，而是发掘可以解决复杂问题的算法。\n神经网络的能力来自它可以从输入数据中学习，对未来进行预测：在这个意义上说，神经网络学习了一种对应关系。数学上说，这种能力是一种有普适性的近似算法。神经网络的预测能力来自网络的分层或多层结构：这种结构可以找出不同尺度或分辨率下的不同特征，将其组合成更高级别的特征。例如，从线条到线条的集合到形状。\n6.3 神经元\n神经网络由人工神经元组成：这些神经元有计算能力，使用激活函数，利用输入和权重，输出一个标量。\n\n6.3.1 神经元权重\n线性回归的权重和这里的权重类似：每个神经元也有一个误差项，永远是1.0，必须被加权。例如，一个神经元有2个输入值，那就需要3个权重项：一个输入一个权重，加上一个误差项的权重。\n权重项的初始值一般是小随机数，例如，0~0.3；也有更复杂的初始化方法。和线性回归一样，权重越大代表网络越复杂，越不稳定。我们希望让权重变小，为此可以使用正则化。\n6.3.2 激活函数\n神经元的所有输入都被加权求和，输入激活函数中。激活函数就是输入的加权求和值到信号输出的映射。激活函数得名于其功能：控制激活哪个神经元，以及输出信号强度。历史上的激活函数是个阈值：例如，输入加权求和超过0.5，则输出1；反之输出0.0。\n激活函数一般使用非线性函数，这样输入的组合方式可以更复杂，提供更多功能。非线性函数可以输出一个分布：例如，逻辑函数（也称为S型函数）输出一个0到1之间的S形分布，正切函数可以输出一个-1到1之间的S形分布。最近的研究表明，线性整流函数的效果更好。\n6.4 神经元网络\n神经元可以组成网络：每行的神经元叫做一层，一个神经网络可以有很多层。神经网络的结构叫做网络拓扑。\n\n6.4.1 输入层\n神经网络最底下的那层叫输入层，因为直接和数据连接。一般的节点数是数据的列数。这层的神经元只将数据传输到下一层。\n6.4.2 隐层\n输入节点后的层叫隐层，因为不直接和外界相连。最简单的网络中，隐层只有一个神经元，直接输出结果。随着算力增加，现在可以训练很复杂，层数很高的神经网络：历史上需要几辈子才能训练的网络，现在有可能几分钟就能训练好。\n6.4.3 输出层\n神经网络的最后一层叫输出层，输出问题需要的值。这层的激活函数由问题的类型而定：\n\n简单的回归问题：有可能只有一个神经元，没有激活函数\n两项的分类问题：有可能只有一个神经元，激活函数是S型函数，输出一个0到1之间的概率，代表主类别的概率。也可以用0.5作为阈值：低于0.5输出0，大于0.5输出1.\n多项的分类问题：有可能有多个神经元，每个代表一类（例如，3个神经元，代表3种不同的鸢尾花 - 这是个经典问题）。激活函数可以使用Softmax函数，每个输出代表是某个类别的概率。最有可能的类别就是输出最高的那组。\n\n6.5 网络训练\n6.5.1 预备数据\n预处理一下数据：数据必须是数值，例如，实数。如果某一项是类别，需要通过独热编码将其变成数字：对于N种可能的类别，加入N列，对其取0或1代表是否属于该类别。\n独热编码也可以对多个类别进行编码：建立一个二进制向量表示类别，输出的结果可以对类别进行分类。神经网络需要所有的数据单位差不多：例如，将所有的数据缩放到0和1之间，这步叫归一化。或者，对数据进行缩放（正则化），让每列的平均值为0，标准差为1。图像的像素数据也应该这样处理。文字输入可以转化为数字，例如某个单词出现的频率，或者用其他的什么办法转化。\n6.5.2 随机梯度下降\n随机梯度下降很经典，现在还是很流行。使用的方式是正向传递：每次对网络输入一行数据，激活每层神经元，得出一个输出值。对数据进行预测也用这种方式。\n我们把输出和预计值进行比较，算出误差；这个错误通过网络反向传播，更新权重数据。这个算法叫反向传播算法。我们在所有的训练数据上重复此过程，每次网络全部更新叫一轮。神经网络可以训练几十乃至成千上万轮。\n6.5.3 权重更新\n神经网络的权重可以每次训练都更新，这种方式叫在线更新，速度很快但是有可能造成灾难性结果。或者也可以保存误差数据，最后只更新一次：这种更新叫批量更新，一般而言更稳妥。\n因为数据集有可能很大，为了计算速度，每次更新的数据量一般不大，只有几十到几百个数据。权重的更新数量由学习速率（步长）这个参数控制，规定神经网络针对错误的更新速度。这个参数一般很小，0.1或者0.01，乃至更小。也可以调整其他参数：\n\n动量：如果上次和这次的方向一样，则加速变化，即使这次的错误不那么大。用于加速网络训练。\n学习速率衰减：随着训练次数增加而减少学习速率。在一开始加速训练，后面微调参数。\n\n6.5.4 进行预测\n训练好的神经网络就可以进行预测了。可以使用测试数据进行测量，看看能不能预测新的数据；也可以部署网络，进行预测。网络只需要保存拓扑结构和最终的权重。将新的数据喂进去，经过前向传输，神经网络就会做出预测了。\n6.6 总结\n本章关于利用人工神经网络进行机器学习。总结一下：\n\n神经网络不是大脑的模型，而是计算模型，可以解决复杂的机器学习问题\n神经网络由带有权重和激活函数的神经元组成\n神经网络分层，用随机梯度下降训练\n应该预处理数据\n\n6.6.1

使用Keras开发神经网络","keywords":"","body":"第7章 使用Keras开发神经网络\nKeras基于Python，开发深度学习模型很容易。Keras将Theano和TensorFlow的数值计算封装好，几句话就可以配置并训练神经网络。本章开始使用Keras开发神经网络。本章将：\n\n将CSV数据读入Keras\n用Keras配置并编译多层感知器模型\n用验证数据集验证Keras模型\n\n我们开始吧。\n7.1 简介\n虽然代码量不大，但是我们还是慢慢来。大体分几步：\n\n导入数据\n定义模型\n编译模型\n训练模型\n测试模型\n写出程序\n\n7.2 皮马人糖尿病数据集\n我们使用皮马人糖尿病数据集（Pima Indians onset of diabetes），在UCI的机器学习网站可以免费下载。数据集的内容是皮马人的医疗记录，以及过去5年内是否有糖尿病。所有的数据都是数字，问题是（是否有糖尿病是1或0），是二分类问题。数据的数量级不同，有8个属性：\n\n怀孕次数\n2小时口服葡萄糖耐量试验中的血浆葡萄糖浓度\n舒张压（毫米汞柱）\n2小时血清胰岛素（mu U/ml)\n体重指数（BMI）\n糖尿病血系功能\n年龄（年）\n类别：过去5年内是否有糖尿病\n\n所有的数据都是数字，可以直接导入Keras。本书后面也会用到这个数据集。数据有768行，前5行的样本长这样：\n6,148,72,35,0,33.6,0.627,50,1\n1,85,66,29,0,26.6,0.351,31,0\n8,183,64,0,0,23.3,0.672,32,1\n1,89,66,23,94,28.1,0.167,21,0\n0,137,40,35,168,43.1,2.288,33,1\n数据在本书代码的data 目录，也可以在UCI机器学习的网站下载。把数据和Python文件放在一起，改名：\npima-indians-diabetes.csv\n基准准确率是65.1%，在10次交叉验证中最高的正确率是77.7%。在UCI机器学习的网站可以得到数据集的更多资料。\n7.3 导入资料\n使用随机梯度下降时最好固定随机数种子，这样你的代码每次运行的结果都一致。这种做法在演示结果、比较算法或debug时特别有效。你可以随便选种子：\n# fix random seed for reproducibility\nseed = 7\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\n现在导入皮马人数据集。NumPy的loadtxt()函数可以直接带入数据，输入变量是8个，输出1个。导入数据后，我们把数据分成输入和输出两组以便交叉检验：\n# load pima indians dataset\ndataset = numpy.loadtxt(\"pima-indians-diabetes.csv\", delimiter=\",\")\n# split into input (X) and output (Y) variables\nX = dataset[:,0:8]\nY = dataset[:,8]\n这样我们的数据每次结果都一致，可以定义模型了。\n7.4 定义模型\nKeras的模型由层构成：我们建立一个Sequential模型，一层层加入神经元。第一步是确定输入层的数目正确：在创建模型时用input_dim参数确定。例如，有8个输入变量，就设成8。\n隐层怎么设置？这个问题很难回答，需要慢慢试验。一般来说，如果网络够大，即使存在问题也不会有影响。这个例子里我们用3层全连接网络。\n全连接层用Dense类定义：第一个参数是本层神经元个数，然后是初始化方式和激活函数。这里的初始化方法是0到0.05的连续型均匀分布（uniform），Keras的默认方法也是这个。也可以用高斯分布进行初始化（normal）。\n前两层的激活函数是线性整流函数（relu），最后一层的激活函数是S型函数（sigmoid）。之前大家喜欢用S型和正切函数，但现在线性整流函数效果更好。为了保证输出是0到1的概率数字，最后一层的激活函数是S型函数，这样映射到0.5的阈值函数也容易。前两个隐层分别有12和8个神经元，最后一层是1个神经元（是否有糖尿病）。\n# create model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, init='uniform', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(8, init='uniform', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, init='uniform', activation='sigmoid'))\n网络的结构如图：\n\n7.5 编译模型\n定义好的模型可以编译：Keras会调用Theano或者TensorFlow编译模型。后端会自动选择表示网络的最佳方法，配合你的硬件。这步需要定义几个新的参数。训练神经网络的意义是：找到最好的一组权重，解决问题。\n我们需要定义损失函数和优化算法，以及需要收集的数据。我们使用binary_crossentropy，错误的对数作为损失函数；adam作为优化算法，因为这东西好用。想深入了解请查阅：Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization论文。因为这个问题是分类问题，我们收集每轮的准确率。\n7.6 训练模型\n终于开始训练了！调用模型的fit()方法即可开始训练。\n网络按轮训练，通过nb_epoch参数控制。每次送入的数据（批尺寸）可以用batch_size参数控制。这里我们只跑150轮，每次10个数据。多试试就知道了。\n# Fit the model\nmodel.fit(X, Y, nb_epoch=150, batch_size=10)\n现在CPU或GPU开始煎鸡蛋了。\n7.7 测试模型\n我们把测试数据拿出来检验一下模型的效果。注意这样不能测试在新数据的预测能力。应该将数据分成训练和测试集。\n调用模型的evaluation()方法，传入训练时的数据。输出是平均值，包括平均误差和其他的数据，例如准确度。\n# evaluate the model\nscores = model.evaluate(X, Y)\nprint(\"%s: %.2f%%\" % (model.metrics_names[1], scores[1]*100))\n7.8 写出程序\n用Keras做机器学习就是这么简单。我们把代码放在一起：\n# Create first network with Keras\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nimport numpy\n# fix random seed for reproducibility\nseed = 7\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\n# load pima indians dataset\ndataset =

model.evaluate(X, Y)\nprint(\"%s: %.2f%%\" % (model.metrics_names[1], scores[1]*100))\n训练时每轮会输出一次损失和正确率，以及最终的效果。在我的CPU上用Theano大约跑10秒：\n...\nEpoch 143/150\n768/768 [==============================] - 0s

分割数据\n数据量大和网络复杂会造成训练时间很长，所以需要将数据分成训练、测试或验证数据集。Keras提供两种办法：\n\n自动验证\n手工验证\n\n8.2.1 自动验证\nKeras可以将数据自动分出一部分，每次训练后进行验证。在训练时用validation_split参数可以指定验证数据的比例，一般是总数据的20%或者33%。下面的代码在第七章上加入了自动验证：\n# MLP with

手工K折交叉验证\n机器学习的金科玉律是K折验证，以验证模型对未来数据的预测能力。K折验证的方法是：将数据分成K组，留下1组验证，其他数据用作训练，直到每种分发的性能一致。\n深度学习一般不用交叉验证，因为对算力要求太高。例如，K折的次数一般是5或者10折：每组都需要训练并验证，训练时间成倍上升。然而，如果数据量小，交叉验证的效果更好，误差更小。\nscikit-learn有StratifiedKFold类，我们用它把数据分成10组。抽样方法是分层抽样，尽可能保证每组数据量一致。然后我们在每组上训练模型，使用verbose=0参数关闭每轮的输出。训练后，Keras会输出模型的性能，并存储模型。最终，Keras输出性能的平均值和标准差，为性能估算提供更准确的估计：\n#

简介\nKeras在深度学习很受欢迎，但是只能做深度学习：Keras是最小化的深度学习库，目标在于快速搭建深度学习模型。基于SciPy的scikit-learn，数值运算效率很高，适用于普遍的机器学习任务，提供很多机器学习工具，包括但不限于：\n\n使用K折验证模型\n快速搜索并测试超参\n\nKeras为scikit-learn封装了KerasClassifier和KerasRegressor。本章我们继续使用第7章的模型。\n9.2

使用网格搜索调整深度学习模型的参数\n使用scikit-learn封装Keras的模型十分简单。进一步想：我们可以给fit()方法传入参数，KerasClassifier的build_fn方法也可以传入参数。可以利用这点进一步调整模型。\n我们用网格搜索测试不同参数的性能：create_model()函数可以传入optimizer和init参数，虽然都有默认值。那么我们可以用不同的优化算法和初始权重调整网络。具体说，我们希望搜索：\n\n优化算法：搜索权重的方法\n初始权重：初始化不同的网络\n训练次数：对模型训练的次数\n批次大小：每次训练的数据量\n\n所有的参数组成一个字典，传入scikit-learn的GridSearchCV类：GridSearchCV会对每组参数（2×3×3×3）进行训练，进行3折交叉检验。\n计算量巨大：耗时巨长。如果模型小还可以取一部分数据试试。第7章的模型可以用，因为网络和数据集都不大（1000个数据内，9个参数）。最后scikit-learn会输出最好的参数和模型，以及平均值。\n#

鸢尾花分类数据集\n本章我们使用经典的鸢尾花数据集。这个数据集已经被充分研究过，4个输入变量都是数字，量纲都是厘米。每个数据代表花朵的不同参数，输出是分类结果。数据的属性是（厘米）：\n\n萼片长度\n萼片宽度\n花瓣长度\n花瓣宽度\n类别\n\n这个问题是多类分类的：有两种以上的类别需要预测，确切的说，3种。这种问题需要对神经网络做出特殊调整。数据有150条：前5行是：\n5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa\n4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa\n4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa\n4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,Iris-setosa\n5.0,3.6,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa\n鸢尾花数据集已经被充分研究，模型的准确率可以达到95%到97%，作为目标很不错。本书的data目录下附带了示例代码和数据，也可以从UCI机器学习网站下载，重命名为iris.csv。数据集的详情请在UCI机器学习网站查询。\n10.2 导入库和函数\n我们导入所需要的库和函数，包括深度学习包Keras、数据处理包pandas和模型测试包scikit-learn。\nimport numpy\nimport pandas\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nfrom keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier\nfrom keras.utils import np_utils\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n10.3 指定随机数种子\n我们指定一个随机数种子，这样重复运行的结果会一致，以便复现随机梯度下降的结果：\n# fix random seed for reproducibility\nseed = 7\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\n10.4 导入数据\n数据可以直接导入。因为数据包含字符，用pandas更容易。然后可以将数据的属性（列）分成输入变量（X）和输出变量（Y）：\n# load dataset\ndataframe = pandas.read_csv(\"iris.csv\", header=None)\ndataset = dataframe.values\nX = dataset[:,0:4].astype(float)\nY = dataset[:,4]\n10.5 输出变量编码\n数据的类型是字符串：在使用神经网络时应该将类别编码成矩阵，每行每列代表所属类别。可以使用独热编码，或者加入一列。这个数据中有3个类别：Iris-setosa、Iris-versicolor和Iris-virginica。如果数据是\nIris-setosa\nIris-versicolor\nIris-virginica\n用独热编码可以编码成这种矩阵：\nIris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica 1, 0, 0\n0, 1, 0\n0, 0, 1\nscikit-learn的LabelEncoder可以将类别变成数字，然后用Keras的to_categorical()函数编码：\n# encode class values as integers\nencoder = LabelEncoder()\nencoder.fit(Y)\nencoded_Y = encoder.transform(Y)\n# convert integers to dummy variables (i.e. one hot encoded)\ndummy_y = np_utils.to_categorical(encoded_Y)\n10.6 设计神经网络\nKeras提供了KerasClassifier，可以将网络封装，在scikit-learn上用。KerasClassifier的初始化变量是模型名称，返回供训练的神经网络模型。\n我们写一个函数，为鸢尾花分类问题创建一个神经网络：这个全连接网络只有1个带有4个神经元的隐层，和输入的变量数相同。为了效果，隐层使用整流函数作为激活函数。因为我们用了独热编码，网络的输出必须是3个变量，每个变量代表一种花，最大的变量代表预测种类。网络的结构是：\n4个神经元 输入层 -> [4个神经元 隐层] -> 3个神经元 输出层\n输出层的函数是S型函数，把可能性映射到概率的0到1。优化算法选择ADAM随机梯度下降，损失函数是对数函数，在Keras中叫categorical_crossentropy：\n# define baseline model\ndef baseline_model():\n# create model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(4, input_dim=4, init='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(3, init='normal', activation='sigmoid'))\n  # Compile model\nmodel.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) return model\n可以用这个模型创建KerasClassifier，也可以传入其他参数，这些参数会传递到fit()函数中。我们将训练次数nb_epoch设成150，批尺寸batch_size设成5，verbose设成0以关闭调试信息：\nestimator = KerasClassifier(build_fn=baseline_model, nb_epoch=200, batch_size=5, verbose=0)\n10.7 用K折交叉检验测试模型\n现在可以测试模型效果了。scikit-learn有很多种办法可以测试模型，其中最重要的就是K折检验。我们先设定模型的测试方法：K设为10（默认值很好），在分割前随机重排数据：\nkfold = KFold(n=len(X), n_folds=10, shuffle=True, random_state=seed)\n这样我们就可以在数据集（X和dummy_y）上用10折交叉检验（kfold）测试性能了。模型需要10秒钟就可以跑完，每次检验输出结果：\nresults = cross_val_score(estimator, X, dummy_y, cv=kfold)\nprint(\"Accuracy: %.2f%% (%.2f%%)\" % (results.mean()*100, results.std()*100))\n输出结果的均值和标准差，这样可以验证模型的预测能力，效果拔群：\nBaseline: 95.33% (4.27%)\n10.8

声呐物体分类数据\n本章使用声呐数据，包括声呐在不同物体的返回。数据有60个变量，代表不同角度的返回值。目标是将石头和金属筒（矿石）分开。\n所有的数据都是连续的，从0到1；输出变量中M代表矿石，R代表石头，需要转换为1和0。数据集有208条数据，在本书的data目录下，也可以自行下载，重命名为sonar.csv。 \n此数据集可以作为性能测试标准：我们知道什么程度的准确率代表模型是优秀的。交叉检验后，一般的网络可以达到84%的准确率，最高可以达到88%。关于数据集详情，请到UCI机器学习网站查看。\n11.2 简单的神经网络\n先创建一个简单的神经网络试试看。导入所有的库和函数：\nimport numpy\nimport pandas\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nfrom keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n初始化随机数种子，这样每次的结果都一样，帮助debug：\n# fix random seed for reproducibility\nseed = 7\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\n用pandas读入数据：前60列是输入变量（X），最后一列是输出变量（Y）。pandas处理带字符的数据比NumPy更容易。\n# load dataset\ndataframe = pandas.read_csv(\"sonar.csv\", header=None)\ndataset = dataframe.values\n# split into input (X) and output (Y) variables\nX = dataset[:,0:60].astype(float)\nY = dataset[:,60]\n输出变量现在是字符串：需要编码成数字0和1。scikit-learn的LabelEncoder可以做到：先将数据用fit()方法导入，然后用transform()函数编码，加入一列：\n# encode class values as integers\nencoder = LabelEncoder()\nencoder.fit(Y)\nencoded_Y = encoder.transform(Y)\n现在可以用Keras创建神经网络模型了。我们用scikit-learn进行随机K折验证，测试模型效果。Keras的模型用KerasClassifier封装后可以在scikit-learn中调用，取的变量建立的模型；其他变量会传入fit()方法中，例如训练次数和批尺寸。我们写一个函数创建这个模型：只有一个全连接层，神经元数量和输入变量数一样，作为最基础的模型。\n模型的权重是比较小的高斯随机数，激活函数是整流函数，输出层只有一个神经元，激活函数是S型函数，代表某个类的概率。损失函数还是对数损失函数（binary_crossentropy），这个函数适用于二分类问题。优化算法是Adam随机梯度下降，每轮收集模型的准确率。\n# baseline model\ndef create_baseline():\n# create model\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(Dense(60, input_dim=60, init='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, init='normal', activation='sigmoid'))\n# Compile model\n    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) return model\n用scikit-learn测试一下模型。向KerasClassifier传入训练次数（默认值），关闭日志：\n```# evaluate model with standardized dataset\nestimator = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_baseline, nb_epoch=100, batch_size=5, verbose=0)\nkfold = StratifiedKFold(y=encoded_Y, n_folds=10, shuffle=True, random_state=seed)\nresults = cross_val_score(estimator, X, encoded_Y, cv=kfold)\nprint(\"Results: %.2f%% (%.2f%%)\" % (results.mean()100, results.std()100))\n\n输出内容是测试的平均数和标准差。\nBaseline: 81.68% (5.67%)\n\n不用很累很麻烦效果也可以很好。\n\n#### 11.3 预处理数据以增加性能\n\n预处理数据是个好习惯。神经网络喜欢输入类型的比例和分布一致，为了达到这点可以使用正则化，让数据的平均值是0，标准差是1，这样可以保留数据的分布情况。\n\nscikit-learn的```StandardScaler```可以做到这点。不应该在整个数据集上直接应用正则化：应该只在测试数据上交叉验证时进行正则化处理，使正则化成为交叉验证的一环，让模型没有新数据的先验知识，防止模型发散。\n\nscikit-learn的```Pipeline```可以直接做到这些。我们先定义一个```StandardScaler```，然后进行验证：\nevaluate baseline model with standardized dataset\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\nestimators = []\nestimators.append(('standardize', StandardScaler()))\nestimators.append(('mlp', KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_baseline, nb_epoch=100,\n    batch_size=5, verbose=0)))\npipeline = Pipeline(estimators)\nkfold = StratifiedKFold(y=encoded_Y, n_folds=10, shuffle=True, random_state=seed)\nresults = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, encoded_Y, cv=kfold)\nprint(\"Standardized: %.2f%% (%.2f%%)\" % (results.mean()100, results.std()100))\n\n结果如下，平均效果有一点进步。\nStandardized: 84.07% (6.23%)\n\n#### 11.4 调整模型的拓扑和神经元\n\n神经网络有很多参数，例如初始化权重、激活函数、优化算法等等。我们一直没有说到调整网络的拓扑结构：扩大或缩小网络。我们试验一下：\n\n##### 11.4.1 缩小网络\n\n有可能数据中有冗余：原始数据是不同角度的信号，有可能其中某些角度有相关性。我们把第一层隐层缩小一些，强行提取特征试试。\n\n我们把之前的模型隐层的60个神经元减半到30个，这样神经网络需要挑选最重要的信息。之前的正则化有效果：我们也一并做一下.\nsmaller model\ndef create_smaller():\ncreate model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(30, input_dim=60, init='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, init='normal', activation='sigmoid'))\nCompile model\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) return model\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\nestimators = []\nestimators.append(('standardize', StandardScaler()))\nestimators.append(('mlp', KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_smaller, nb_epoch=100,\n    batch_size=5, verbose=0)))\npipeline = Pipeline(estimators)\nkfold = StratifiedKFold(y=encoded_Y, n_folds=10, shuffle=True, random_state=seed)\nresults = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, encoded_Y, cv=kfold)\nprint(\"Smaller: %.2f%% (%.2f%%)\" % (results.mean()100, results.std()100))\n\n结果如下。平均值有少许提升，方差减少很多：这么做果然有效，因为这次的训练时间只需要之前的一半！\nSmaller: 84.61% (4.65%)\n\n##### 11.4.2 扩大网络\n\n扩大网络后，神经网络更有可能提取关键特征，以非线性方式组合。我们对之前的网络简单修改一下：在原来的隐层后加入一层30个神经元的隐层。现在的网络是：\n60 inputs -> [60 -> 30] -> 1 output\n\n我们希望在缩减信息前可以对所有的变量建模，和缩小网络时的想法类似。这次我们加一层，帮助网络挑选信息：\nlarger model\ndef create_larger():\ncreate model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(60, input_dim=60, init='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(30, init='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, init='normal', activation='sigmoid'))\nCompile model\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) return model\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\nestimators = []\nestimators.append(('standardize', StandardScaler()))\nestimators.append(('mlp', KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_larger, nb_epoch=100,\n    batch_size=5, verbose=0)))\npipeline = Pipeline(estimators)\nkfold = StratifiedKFold(y=encoded_Y, n_folds=10, shuffle=True, random_state=seed)\nresults = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, encoded_Y, cv=kfold)\nprint(\"Larger: %.2f%% (%.2f%%)\" % (results.mean()100, results.std()100))\n\n这次的结果好了很多，几乎达到业界最优。\nLarger: 86.47% (3.82%)\n```\n继续微调网络的结果会更好。你能做到如何？\n11.5

波士顿住房价格数据\n本章我们研究波士顿住房价格数据集，即波士顿地区的住房信息。我们关心的是住房价格，单位是千美金：所以，这个问题是回归问题。数据有13个输入变量，代表房屋不同的属性：\n\nCRIM：人均犯罪率\nZN：25,000平方英尺以上民用土地的比例\nINDUS：城镇非零售业商用土地比例\nCHAS：是否邻近查尔斯河，1是邻近，0是不邻近\nNOX：一氧化氮浓度（千万分之一）\nRM：住宅的平均房间数\nAGE：自住且建于1940年前的房屋比例\nDIS：到5个波士顿就业中心的加权距离\nRAD：到高速公路的便捷度指数\nTAX：每万元的房产税率\nPTRATIO：城镇学生教师比例\nB： 1000(Bk − 0.63)2 其中Bk是城镇中黑人比例\nLSTAT：低收入人群比例\nMEDV：自住房中位数价格，单位是千元\n\n这个问题已经被深入研究过，所有的数据都是数字。数据的前5行是：\n0.00632 18.00 2.310 0 0.5380 6.5750 65.20 4.0900 1 296.0 15.30 396.90 4.98 24.00\n0.02731 0.00

36.20\n数据在本书的data目录下，也可以自行下载，重命名为housing.csv。普通模型的均方误差（MSE）大约是20，和方差（SSE）是$4,500美金。关于数据集详情，请到UCI机器学习网站查看。\n12.2 简单的神经网络\n先创建一个简单的回归神经网络。导入所有的库和函数：\nimport numpy\nimport pandas\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nfrom keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasRegressor\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n源文件是CSV格式，分隔符是空格：可以用pandas导入，然后分成输入（X）和输出（Y）变量。\n# load dataset\ndataframe = pandas.read_csv(\"housing.csv\", delim_whitespace=True, header=None)\ndataset = dataframe.values\n# split into input (X) and output (Y) variables\nX = dataset[:,0:13]\nY = dataset[:,13]\nKeras可以把模型封装好，交给scikit-learn使用，方便测试模型。我们写一个函数，创建神经网络。\n代码如下。有一个全连接层，神经元数量和输入变量数一致（13），激活函数还是整流函数。输出层没有激活函数，因为在回归问题中我们希望直接取结果。\n优化函数是Adam，损失函数是MSE，和我们要优化的函数一致：这样可以对模型的预测有直观的理解，因为MSE乘方就是千美元计的误差。\n# define base mode\ndef baseline_model():\n# create model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(13, input_dim=13, init='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, init='normal'))\n  # Compile model\nmodel.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam') return model\n使用KerasRegressor封装这个模型，任何其他的变量都会传入fit()函数中，例如训练次数和批次大小，这里我们取默认值。老规矩，为了可以复现结果，指定一下随机数种子：\n# fix random seed for reproducibility\nseed = 7\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\n# evaluate model with standardized dataset\nestimator = KerasRegressor(build_fn=baseline_model, nb_epoch=100, batch_size=5, verbose=0)\n可以测试一下基准模型的结果了：用10折交叉检验看看。\nkfold = KFold(n=len(X), n_folds=10, random_state=seed)\nresults = cross_val_score(estimator, X, Y, cv=kfold)\nprint(\"Results: %.2f (%.2f) MSE\" % (results.mean(), results.std()))\n结果是10次检验的误差均值和标准差。\nResults: 38.04 (28.15) MSE\n12.3 预处理数据以增加性能\n这个数据集的特点是变量的尺度不一致，所以标准化很有用。\nscikit-learn的Pipeline可以直接进行均一化处理并交叉检验，这样模型不会预先知道新的数据。代码如下：\n# evaluate model with standardized dataset\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\nestimators = []\nestimators.append(('standardize', StandardScaler()))\nestimators.append(('mlp', KerasRegressor(build_fn=baseline_model, nb_epoch=50,\n    batch_size=5, verbose=0)))\npipeline = Pipeline(estimators)\nkfold = KFold(n=len(X), n_folds=10, random_state=seed)\nresults = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, Y, cv=kfold)\nprint(\"Standardized: %.2f (%.2f) MSE\" % (results.mean(), results.std()))\n效果直接好了一万刀：\nStandardized: 28.24 (26.25) MSE\n也可以将数据标准化，在最后一层用S型函数作为激活函数，将比例拉到一样。\n12.4 调整模型的拓扑\n神经网络有很多可调的参数：最可玩的是网络的结构。这次我们用一个更深的和一个更宽的模型试试。\n12.4.1 更深的模型\n增加神经网络的层数可以提高效果，这样模型可以提取并组合更多的特征。我们试着加几层隐层：加几句话就行。代码从上面复制下来，在第一层后加一层隐层，神经元数量是上层的一半：\ndef larger_model():\n# create model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(13, input_dim=13, init='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(6, init='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, init='normal'))\n  # Compile model\nmodel.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam') return model\n这样的结构是：\n13 inputs -> [13 -> 6] -> 1 output\n测试的方法一样，数据正则化一下：\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\nestimators = []\nestimators.append(('standardize', StandardScaler()))\nestimators.append(('mlp', KerasRegressor(build_fn=larger_model, nb_epoch=50, batch_size=5,\n    verbose=0)))\npipeline = Pipeline(estimators)\nkfold = KFold(n=len(X), n_folds=10, random_state=seed)\nresults = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, Y, cv=kfold)\nprint(\"Larger: %.2f (%.2f) MSE\" % (results.mean(), results.std()))\n效果好了一点，MSE从28变成24：\nLarger: 24.60 (25.65) MSE\n12.4.1 更宽的模型\n加宽模型可以增加网络容量。我们减去一层，把隐层的神经元数量加大，从13加到20：\ndef wider_model():\n# create model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(20, input_dim=13, init='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, init='normal'))\n  # Compile model\nmodel.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam') return model\n网络的结构是：\n13 inputs -> [20] -> 1 output\n跑一下试试：\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\nestimators = []\nestimators.append(('standardize', StandardScaler()))\nestimators.append(('mlp', KerasRegressor(build_fn=wider_model, nb_epoch=100, batch_size=5,\n    verbose=0)))\npipeline = Pipeline(estimators)\nkfold = KFold(n=len(X), n_folds=10, random_state=seed)\nresults = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, Y, cv=kfold)\nprint(\"Wider: %.2f (%.2f) MSE\" % (results.mean(), results.std()))\nMSE下降到21，效果不错了。\nWider: 21.64 (23.75) MSE\n很难想到，加宽模型比加深模型效果更好：这就是欧皇的力量。\n12.5
